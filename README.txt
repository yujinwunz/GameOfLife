Introduction

Game of life is an app that simulates Conway's game of life in five different "colours".
It is reasonably fast in that it doesn't rely on a matrix. It keeps track of each live cell and also of all cells that have changed states, in order to reduce the number of cells that need to be calculated after each generation.

FILES

/Game of Life/Source/ contains all the source files.

/Release/ contains compiled binaries that run on windows.

INSTALL

You will need Visual C++ (I used 2012) to compile this.
You need VC development libraries for SDL 1.2, get it from http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php

Open the visual studio project, and add your SDL include and SDL library directories in order to compile.
